Based on your question about the UI flow, let me explain the reasoning for showing schema drift after column-level lineage mapping in Option 2:

Sequential Flow Logic (Option 2):

1. File Discovery → First, we identify what files exist and their basic structure
2. Column Lineage Mapping → Next, we analyze how source columns map to destination tables
3. Schema Drift Detection → Finally, we compare current vs baseline schemas to detect changes

Why This Order Makes Sense:

Dependencies: Schema drift detection relies on the column mappings established in step 2. The drift analysis needs to know:

- Which source columns map to which destination columns
- What transformations are applied (rename, type conversion, etc.)
- What the expected target schema should be

Business Context: In your healthcare data pipeline:

- Column lineage establishes the "expected" transformation path
- Schema drift then validates whether the current data matches those expectations
- If drift is detected, the user can see exactly which mapped columns are affected

Alternative Approach - Parallel Detection:
If you prefer, we could modify the flow to:

- Detect schema drift during file discovery (already implemented)
- Show schema drift section immediately when detected
- Keep column lineage as a separate analysis step

The current sequential approach follows enterprise data governance best practices where you establish the mapping rules first, then validate compliance.
